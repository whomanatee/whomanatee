<h2 id="personal-projects">Personal projects:</h2>
<ul class="reader-view comfy">
    <li>Anything you desire to work on.

    <li>The institution will have resources available for everyone to use. And the more you create, the increased access you have to institution resources. For example, if you want to direct movies, you'll start off by using cheaper equipment. Then as you progress in your directing abilities, you'll get access to better and better equipment.

    <li>Same with if you want to make music. You'll start off with having access to basic musical instruments, recording equipment, etc, and as you progress you'll get increased access to better studios, equipment, etc. The same goes for performance. In the beginning you can perform at smaller venues, and then as you progress you can eventually have access to stadiums.

    <li>Note that much of your learning can count towards your work time and will not need to take place during your personal time. Maybe you've always wanted to make furniture. Maybe you want to learn to fly planes. Maybe you want to learn medicine to help humans. Maybe you want to learn law to help humans. All of these can likely be done on work time and not during your personal time.

    <li>What do you want to work on in your free time? Come to a <a href="/discussion/" target="_blank" class="nowrap">public discussion</a> and let everyone know, and we'll make sure that this institution has everything you need to make your personal ambitions come true.

<h2 id="questions">Some likely to be asked questions:</h2>
<ul class="reader-view comfy">
    <li><b><small>Is this a serious plan?</small></b><br/>
        Yes.

    <li><b><small>Do I need a college degree to join and live amazing?</small></b><br/>
        No college degree required. You can learn everything with the institution.

    <li><b><small>What if I didn't finish high school?</small></b><br/>
        There are no degree requirements, including high school or even kindergarten.

    <li><b><small>What if I already went to college, AKA higher school?</small></b><br/>
        All knowledge is needed and valued. Bring your experience. We'll need people that are already able to practice medicine, construct buildings, build electronics, and much more. The work you are doing currently can seamlessly transition over to this institution.

    <li><b><small>What if I'm a baby, can I join?</small></b><br/>
        Yes, all babies can join for $25k like everyone else to recieve all benefits including free health coverage, food, a roof, and much more.

    <li><b><small>Will I really be able to rest 5 days a week instead of working 5 days a week?</small></b><br/>
        Yes, we will build and upgrade cities so that people only need to work 2 days or less per week for the whole thing to operate. It's up to you to decide your work schedule. You could work full time for about 5 months per year and then have off for 7 months, or you can work the 2 days a week for the entire year, et cetera.

    <li><b><small>What do I do with my free time?</small></b><br/>
        Anything you desire. Travel the world. Work on your ideas. And the institution will have all the resources necessary to bring your ideas to life.

    <li><b><small>What if my ideas need lots of money?</small></b><br/>
        You'll have lots of people around with lots of money, so you'll just need to persuade some of them to allocate funds for your project(s).

    <li><b><small>Will it be like Shark Tank?</small></b><br/>
        Sort of, more like Dolphin Ocean.

    <li><b><small>What if my ideas need lots of people and expertise?</small></b><br/>
        You'll have lots of people around looking for something to do. And they'll have lots of expertise. So you'll just need to persuade some people to work with you on your ideas.
